Here are the orginal instructions for the classes review of my Python II class 
Originally done 1/10/23
Create a program that has:
One parent class
At least two subclasses
Each class/subclass has 2 unique methods
When the program runs, you ask the user questions and use their answers to initialize an object
You will likely use conditionals to determine which subclass to use when initializing
Everything beyond that is up to you - be creative!
